# predict_MJO_SPCAM

Includes data and code for analyzing SPCAM potential predictability experiment forecasts. For storage reasons, only MJO indices (ROMI) for each forecast is included, which are the only data needed for reproducing the figures in the paper. 

Code to reproduce the figures is also included, along with the functions used to calculate the ROMI. Modifications to the SPCAM source code are not included here, but can be shared upon request.
